# Performance Evaluation of Ensemble Classifier Models Using Iris Dataset

## Project Overview
This project focuses on comparing the performance of various ensemble classifier models applied to the well-known Iris dataset. The goal is to understand how different ensemble techniques, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost, perform in classifying the three types of Iris flowers based on their morphological features.

## Dataset
- **Iris Dataset:** Contains 150 samples with 4 features each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)
- The dataset is widely used for classification tasks in machine learning and is included in many libraries such as scikit-learn.

## Models Evaluated
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- AdaBoost Classifier
- XGBoost

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries installed:

## Usage
- Load the Iris dataset
- Preprocess the dataset (e.g., train-test split, feature scaling as needed)
- Train each ensemble model
- Evaluate the models using the above metrics
- Visualize the results with graphs and confusion matrices

## Future Work
- Extend evaluation to other datasets
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for each model
- Compare with other classification algorithms outside ensembles
